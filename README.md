## Puzzle

Simplyfied rules from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashiwokakero).

Played in rectangular grid. Encircled cells are islands numbers from 1 to 8 inclusive. The rest of the cells are empty.

The goal is to connect all of the islands by drawing a series of bridges between the islands. 

The bridges must follow certain criteria:
- All islands must be connected.
- Bridged cannot cross.
- Bridges are only established orthogonally, never diagonally.
- At most two bridges connect a pair of islands.
- An island must hold bridges that mathces it's own number.

Plot-twist is that there may not be only 1 solution. Sometimes the structure of the board allows to have 2 different ways to go and still fulfill all the rules.
